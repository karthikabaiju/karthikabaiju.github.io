        <p>Compass is Microsoft's data center construction management solution. 
          The goal for the solution is to streamline the data center construction commissioning, safety, and quality processes. 
          Issue module is one of the backbones of the solution. It helps in keeping track of the commissioning issues found on-site or during testing. 
          It is one of the most widely used modules in the Compass system.

    <p class="content-heading">The Challenge</p>
    <p class="content-heading-details">It was time for a redesign of the Issue module to increasing the user experience.</p>
    <p>
      The issue module is one of the widely used features in Compass, but this is also the module that gets the most number of user tickets.
      <ol>
        <li>The issue management page has too many details in it. Some are capturing/displaying redundant or not users information as well.</li>
        <li>The user is entering 22 out of 64 fields, ie 20.5% of the whole fields. Furthermore, there are lots of hidden fields and grids. No one knows what they do or why they are in the form.</li>
        <li>The flow becomes stuck at places such that the users are not able to proceed with their tasks.</li>
        <li>Multiple places had gaps in the flows which forced the users to move outside the application to get things done.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>We decided that it was time for a redesign of the module to increasing the user experience. 
        I lead the user study, user research, and insights part of the redesign.</b>

    <p class="content-heading">Research</p>
    <p class="content-heading-details">A quick look at where the module stood now showed that it had many issues and gaps.</p>
    <p>
      An extensive study on our competitors showed that we were lagging in many aspects. 
      We were playing catch-up. There were lots of functionalities that were missing. 
      I conducted user interviews with users across the different regions (EMEA, APAC, and AMERS), and having different access permissions in the module. 
      It made me realize that Compass has many gaps and pain points.

    <img class="imageModal image-padding" src="../assets/images/compass_issue/Experience Map.svg" />

    <p class="content-heading-details">The major areas and gaps that needed focus.</p>
    <p>
      From studying and discussing the experience map with the team, I was able to identify the, major areas and gaps that needed focus.

      <ol>
        <li>Too many clicks, too confusing.</li>
        <li>Redundant and duplicate data.</li>
        <li> No way to pin issues to the site map.</li>
        <li>Issue verification step has too many gaps.</li>
        <li>Difficult to keep track of issues.</li>
        <li>Too many email ping pongs outside the system.</li>
        <li> File upload was an experience nightmare.</li>

    <p>
      The research insights and storyboards were handed over to another designer in the team to lead the prototype and iteration. 
      We had multiple design discussions, iteration, and scraping things till we finally came to a design that the users were able to navigate and make sense of without any difficulty.

    <div id="form" style="margin-top: 10%;">
      <p class="content-heading-details">Creation of an issue</p>
      <p>One main improvement that we strived to bring about was to make the creation of an issue easier. 
        We redesigned it to be lighter by removing the amount of information that the user had to enter to create the issue record.
        To reduce confusion for the users, we removed out all redundant data.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The old design was not intuitive about how to add an attachment and where to find archived attachments. </li>
          <li>Attachments need to be added at different stages of the issue resolution process. The attachment part was separate from the rest of the issue functionalities. Thus made it hard to find.</li>
          <li>It lacked functionalities like drag and drop for attachments and file preview for the uploaded attachments.</li>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>One of the main pain points that I came across during the user research was the inability of users to communicate with users inside the system. 
            All communications happened outside the system through Teams Chat or Outlook email. 
            It proved difficult for the users to keep track of the threads for each issue record update. 
            Email threads went missing, some people were missed out in the conversation, 
            others were not able to see what all decisions were made for an issue. 
            So, we introduced the threaded discussion in our system in the Issue module. 
            Out of all the enhancements introduced in the redesigned Issue Module, 
            this was the one that the users were most excited about having.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add comments and discussions directly in the issue record itself.</li>
            <li>The threaded discussion allowed the users to find all discussions and decisions that happened in the issues. </li>
            <li>The discussions are accessible from all pages of the issue module. This reduced the need for the users to step out of the Compass system.</li>
            <li>They can mention other users to get their attention in the discussions. </li>
            <li>The users can reply to any conversation thread. Keeping similar discussions together.</li>
            <li>Search for people and discussion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I designed the UX experience for the threaded discussion. 
            I kept the text box for the main discussion on the top so that the latest discussion showed first. 
            The initial design was to have the latest activity at the end and have a scroll bar instead of the pagination. 
            But during the usability testing, we found that the users preferred pagination better than scrolling since it gave them more control for huge discussions.

    <p class="content-heading">My Learnings</p>
    <p class="content-heading-details">Some of the things that I learnt while working on this project.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Working in collaboration with other designers:</b> I learned that you don’t need to do the whole design process to create an impact on the project. .   
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Convincing stakeholders: </b> People tend to resonate better when you tell them a story rather than just hard-core numbers. 
        Show how your new design would improve the matrix after telling the story has more impact.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Not everyone would have the whole context:</b> 
        Not everyone who you are trying to convince will have the full context. 
        It always helps to start from the very beginning, giving existing context and pain points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Working with multiple designers makes the design better:</b> 
        We had discussions on each element of the design and why it was designed that way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Users are always ready to tell you what is not working in your product:</b> 
        Users are more than willing to tell you where they are getting stuck in the product. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Working with technical constraints:</b> 
        Creating and fighting for good UX when there is a technical constraint for the functionality development. 
        Compromises are needed along the way, but there should not be any compromise in the experience that we provide to the user.
